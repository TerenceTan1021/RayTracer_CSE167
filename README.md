RayTracer Program(CSE 167, WINTER 2025)

This is a simple RayTracer program, that I have created with the knowlegde gained from CSE 167 Winter 2025. 

To run the program, when confirguring and building the program/file. Make sure to run the program with 3 arguments

`<int: samples_per_pixel> <int: max_ray_bounces> <int: scene_id>`

Here is the [Write Up](Write_Up.md)
